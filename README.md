Automatically join 2b2t at selected times

## Requirements
Python 3.5+
```
pip install pyautogui
pip install pywin32
pip install discord_webhook
pip install pillow
pip install opencv-python
```
There is a problem with the latest version of numpy,
so once you install opencv-python go into cmd and type
'pip uninstall numpy'
then 
'pip install numpy==1.19.3'
to get a working version of numpy

## To use
Run script and select time you would like to join 2b2t.
I reccomend 4-6 hours before you desire to play, ex. you get up
at 10 am you should set the time to log in at 2 am.
